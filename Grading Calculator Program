/* Instructions: Write a program that allows the user to enter the grade scored in a programming class (0 - 100).
If the user scored a 100 then notify the user that they got a perfect score.

★ Modify the program so that if the user scored a 90-100 it informs the user that they scored an A.

★★ Modify the program so that it will notify the user of their letter grade 0-59 F 60-69 D 70-79 C 80-89 B 90-100 A.

★★★ Modify the program so the user can input multipule of grades using a loop.

★★★★ Modify the program so that the user can input their name at the beginning of the grading program.

★★★★★★ Modify the program so that the user puts all the grades in a list and gives out the average grade in class.
